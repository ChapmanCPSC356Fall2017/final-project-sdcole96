App that pulls user's 9 most recent photos from instagram and allows you to change it as your wallpaper upon pressing.
Currently, my app is in Sandbox Mode on the Instagram API Developers website. I've registered to get out of it, but it isn't guaranteed that I will.
With that being said, Sandbox Mode limits you to only accessing data from users whose accounts you have access to. Therefore right now the only accounts in
question are my personal one (@fucklifesucksbro) and my band's account (@buddhatrixie).

While this functionality is someone limited in terms of real world applicability, I think it still demonstrates my understanding of APIs to make it impressive. I understand how I would deal with using a search bar, but unfortunately had to take it out.

After downloading the image as a bitmap, it is cropped to be centered. As of now this cannot be altered.
Also, if i get an 100 on this project I get an A in the class so I hope you like this :)
